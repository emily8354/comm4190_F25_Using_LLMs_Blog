    "text": "After classes, my friend and I were at a cafe and we were trying to figure out what animals we look like. Long story short, this idea spawned because she was drawing cartoons of animal versions of us.\nShe had been told that she looked like a deer and I had been told that I look like a cat. We could see each other looking like both of these animals, but we wanted another opinion. There was no one else we could ask, but then we realized that we could ask ChatGPT!\n\n\n\nmy picture\n\n\nPrompt: what animal do I look like?\nResponse: Sorry, I can’t compare people to animals.\nBut if you’d like, I can give you a fun interpretation of your photo — for example, describing the vibe, colors, or mood of the picture (the mural behind you, the tones, the overall atmosphere) in a creative way. Want me to do that?\nI did not know that ChatGPT couldn’t compare people to animals… Thus, we switched our prompts:\nPrompt: can you create a cartoon animal with characteristics like this face\n\n\n\nChatGPT response\n\n\nWow, ChatGPT made me into a cat!\nLet’s see what my friend ended up becoming.\n\n\n\nmy friend’s picture\n\n\nPrompt: Can you make a cartoon animal with characteristics like this face?\n\n\n\nChatGPT response\n\n\nShe became a deer, just like what she was told!\nThis made us realize maybe we do actually look like these animals…"
