    "text": "While talking to large language models like ChatGPT, you might wonder: does politeness actually matter? After all, these systems are machines and they don‚Äôt have feelings. They don‚Äôt get annoyed if you forget to say ‚Äúplease‚Äù or ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù However, should we still talk to them as if they were other humans? I am trying to explore if the way you phrase your prompts can sometimes change the quality of the responses you get.\n\n\n\nTo test this idea, I designed a small experiment. I created pairs of prompts across 3 different common tasks (like summarization, explaining, and brainstorming). Each pair had a blunt version and a polite version.\nLet‚Äôs see the results!"

    "section": "Overall Conclusion",
    "text": "Overall Conclusion\nBased on these experiments, I believe that being polite to ChatGPT can be helpful at times and give you better responses, especially for tasks that could have more variation.\nFor the explanation task, in my opinion, the response to the polite prompt was much more informative and clear with sections like ‚ÄúEveryday analogy‚Äù. The polite response seemed more structured and was a little friendlier with the ‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù at the beginning. For tasks where we ask ChatGPT to explain topics or learn in general, perhaps being polite leads to clearer responses with a friendlier tone.\nFor the brainstorming task, I found the polite response more useful for this task because it provided descriptions of each idea instead of just the title of the idea. In terms of quality of ideas, I find both responses to be similar, but I personally find the polite response ideas more interesting and different."

We could see each other looking like both of these animals, but we wanted another opinion. There was no one else we could ask, but then we realized that we could ask ChatGPT!"
