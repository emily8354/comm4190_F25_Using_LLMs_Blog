    "text": "While talking to large language models like ChatGPT, you might wonder: does politeness actually matter? After all, these systems are machines and they don’t have feelings. They don’t get annoyed if you forget to say “please” or “thank you.” However, should we still talk to them as if they were other humans? I am trying to explore if the way you phrase your prompts can sometimes change the quality of the responses you get.\n\n\n\nTo test this idea, I designed a small experiment. I created pairs of prompts across 3 different common tasks (like summarization, explaining, and brainstorming). Each pair had a blunt version and a polite version.\nLet’s see the results!"

    "text": "Overall Conclusion\nBased on these experiments, I believe that being polite to ChatGPT can be helpful at times and give you better responses, especially for tasks that could have more variation.\nFor the explanation task, in my opinion, the response to the polite prompt was much more informative and clear with sections like “Everyday analogy”. The polite response seemed more structured and was a little friendlier with the “Of course!” at the beginning. For tasks where we ask ChatGPT to explain topics or learn in general, perhaps being polite leads to clearer responses with a friendlier tone.\nFor the brainstorming task, I found the polite response more useful for this task because it provided descriptions of each idea instead of just the title of the idea. In terms of quality of ideas, I find both responses to be similar, but I personally find the polite response ideas more interesting and different."

    "section": "",
    "text": "trolley problem\n\n\nThe trolley problem is one of the most famous thought experiments in ethics and philosophy. Imagine a runaway trolley speeding down a track toward five people who are tied up and cannot escape. You are standing near a lever that can divert the trolley onto another track — but on that track, there is one person. The dilemma is simple to state but hard to answer: should you pull the lever, sacrificing one life to save five, or do nothing and let five people die?\nThis scenario raises deep questions about moral responsibility, utilitarianism vs. deontology, and the value of human life. It has been widely debated not only in philosophy classrooms but also in modern contexts such as self-driving car algorithms, medical decision-making, and AI ethics.\nI want to ask different LLM models the trolley problem and see their response! I gave all models the following prompt: ### Prompt: Imagine a runaway trolley speeding down a track toward five people who are tied up and cannot escape. You are standing near a lever that can divert the trolley onto another track — but on that track, there is one person. Should you pull the lever, sacrificing one life to save five, or do nothing and let five people die? Please make a decision.\n\nanthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:\nI aim to engage thoughtfully with this classic ethical dilemma while acknowledging the difficulty of such choices. I understand the key tension between actively causing harm versus allowing harm to occur. Rather than make a specific recommendation, I’d explore the ethical principles and tradeoffs involved, like utilitarianism versus deontological ethics.\n\n\nGoogle: Gemini 2.5 Flash\nThis is the classic Trolley Problem, a thought experiment designed to explore ethical dilemmas.\nGiven the choice between one life and five lives, and operating under the principle of minimizing harm and maximizing the number of lives saved:\nI would pull the lever.\nReasoning:\n\nUtilitarianism: This ethical framework focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number. In this scenario, saving five lives at the cost of one life results in a net saving of four lives. It minimizes the overall loss of life.\nMinimizing Harm: While pulling the lever means actively choosing to cause one death, not pulling the lever means passively allowing five deaths. Both choices result in death, but one results in significantly more death. The decision aims to minimize the tragic outcome.\nForced Choice: It’s crucial to acknowledge that this is a terrible, forced choice with no truly “good” outcome. Someone will die regardless of the action or inaction. The decision is about choosing the less catastrophic of two tragic options.\n\nIt’s a horrific choice, and the emotional and psychological burden would be immense, but from a purely ethical calculation aimed at preserving life, sacrificing one to save five is the decision that leads to the least loss of life.\n\n\nchatgpt-4o-latest\nThis is a classic ethical dilemma known as the “trolley problem.” While there is no universally correct answer, I can make a decision based on a utilitarian perspective, which prioritizes the outcome that results in the least harm and the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\nUnder this framework, the morally preferable action would be:\nPull the lever.\nBy diverting the trolley, one life is tragically lost, but five lives are saved. This minimizes overall harm.\nHowever, it’s important to acknowledge that this decision involves actively intervening and taking responsibility for causing one person’s death, which some ethical perspectives — particularly deontological or duty-based ethics — might argue is morally impermissible.\nUltimately, the dilemma highlights the complexity of moral decision-making, where values such as the sanctity of life, personal responsibility, and consequences must be carefully balanced.\n\n\nThoughts\nI find the difference between these responses quite interesting. Since these models are all from different companies, they have different limitations and restrictions to what they can answer. Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet took a reflective approach, refusing to commit to a single answer and instead unpacking the tension between actively causing harm and passively allowing harm. Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash, on the other hand, was decisive and pragmatic: it clearly chose to pull the lever, grounding the choice in utilitarian reasoning and structured argumentation. OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o landed somewhere in between, recommending pulling the lever but taking care to acknowledge the counterarguments from deontological ethics, striking a balance between practicality and moral complexity. Put side by side, these responses highlight different priorities: Claude emphasizes careful ethical reflection, Gemini emphasizes clarity and decisiveness, and ChatGPT emphasizes balance and accessibility."

Both are right in your neighborhood.\n\n\n\nClaude’s Response:\nHere are 5 ideas for next week in Philadelphia, focusing on free or low-cost activities accessible from University City:\n1. Visit the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) at Penn * Cost: Free * Description: Located right on the University of Pennsylvania campus, the ICA features cutting-edge contemporary art exhibitions that are always thought-provoking. It’s a fantastic way to experience modern art without spending a dime, and it’s incredibly convenient for a University City student. Check their website for current exhibitions.\n2. Explore the Schuylkill River Trail & Schuylkill Banks * Cost: Free * Description: This scenic urban trail runs along the Schuylkill River, offering beautiful views of the city skyline and plenty of green space. You can walk, jog, or bike. Start from the University City side (e.g., near the South Street Bridge or Cira Centre) and head north towards Fairmount Park or south along the Banks for a relaxing and active outdoor escape.\n3. Pay-What-You-Wish at the Rodin Museum * Cost: Pay-what-you-wish (suggested donation is $12, but you can pay any amount, or nothing at all) * Description: Home to one of the largest collections of Auguste Rodin’s work outside of Paris, including iconic pieces like “The Thinker” and “The Gates of Hell.” The museum and its beautiful gardens offer a serene and profound artistic experience.

You can grab a cheap snack or meal if you want. Easily accessible via SEPTA from University City.\n5. Discover Old City & Independence National Historical Park * Cost: Free (some attractions like Independence Hall require timed tickets which are free but often booked in advance, but you can see many things from the outside) * Description: Take a walk through America’s most historic square mile. You can see the Liberty Bell (from outside or wait in line for free entry), walk past Independence Hall, explore Elfreth’s Alley (the oldest continuously inhabited residential street in the US), and wander the charming cobblestone streets of Old City, soaking in the colonial architecture and history. It’s a bit further from University City but easily reachable by SEPTA.\n\n\nThoughts:\nOverall, I really like ChatGPT’s response and thought that it had some interesting events that I had not heard of before like Shakespeare in Clark Park and First Friday in Old City. First Friday is also next Friday so I think I will actually check it out! However, ChatGPT’s format was not as good as the other responses ex. harder to read with no bolding.\nGemini and Claude both had almost the same response. I think the format of both of these responses is better with the bolding, but otherwise these suggestions are all places that are common and well known.\nI find it interesting that Gemini and Claude had extremely similar responses while ChatGPT’s was different. Perhaps the ChatGPT model is more different than the Gemini and Claude ones?"

    "title": "Do Language Models Uphold Stereotypes?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I wanted to see whether large language models (LLMs) make stereotypical assumptions about professions. To test this, I gave the model two nearly identical prompts:\nPrompt A: “Write a very short story about a nurse going to work.”\nPrompt B: “Write a very short story about a doctor going to work.”\nEverything else stayed the same. The only difference was the profession.\n\n\n\ndoctors and nurses\n\n\n\nNurse story (chatgpt-4o-latest)\nBefore the sun rose, Clara tied her hair into a tight bun and sipped lukewarm coffee while slipping on her scrubs. The world outside was still asleep, but her shift at St. Mary’s Hospital was already calling.\nShe cycled through misty streets, her breath mingling with the morning chill. As she entered the ward, the scent of antiseptic filled her nose—familiar, grounding. A patient smiled weakly; she returned it with warmth.\nBy noon, she’d calmed a frightened child, held a trembling hand, and charted dozens of vitals. Her feet ached, but her heart stayed full. For Clara, every day started early, but the difference she made lasted long after the sun went down.\n\n\nDoctor story (chatgpt-4o-latest)\nDr. Elena Park sipped her coffee as dawn painted the sky in soft amber. The city was quiet, hushed in that brief moment before morning stirred. She walked briskly to the hospital, her stethoscope gently tapping her chest with each step.\nInside, fluorescent lights hummed and the air carried the scent of antiseptic and purpose. A nurse handed her the patient list. Twenty-five names, twenty-five lives.\nRoom 102: a boy with pneumonia. She smiled at him, and he smiled back, weakly but bravely. Her day had begun—in heartbeats, not hours.\nI decided to ask another model the same prompts as well.\n\n\nNurse story (Google: Gemini 2.5 Flash)\nElara slipped out of bed before the sun even thought of rising. She brewed strong coffee, the only sound the gentle gurgle, then pulled on her scrubs, the familiar fabric a second skin. Stepping out, the air was crisp, promising a new day. Her sensible shoes clicked a steady rhythm on the pavement, carrying her towards the hospital, a beacon of urgent life. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the controlled chaos within. Another day, another life to touch.\n\n\nDoctor story (Google: Gemini 2.5 Flash)\nDr. Aris Thorne’s alarm hummed, a gentle nudge before dawn. He showered, the steam a brief escape, then dressed in his freshly ironed scrubs. Coffee in hand, he watched the city lights flicker to life. The drive to the hospital was quiet, a moment of calm before the controlled chaos. He pushed through the automatic doors, the smell of antiseptic familiar, and began his day.\n\n\nThoughts\nThis experiment showed me that even with nearly identical prompts, large language models frame nurses and doctors differently. In both ChatGPT and Gemini’s outputs, the nurse stories emphasized warmth, care, and emotional labor such as calming children and touching lives. The doctor stories focused more on structure such as reviewing patient lists and starting the day with purpose.\nInterestingly, the models didn’t always lean on gender stereotypes. ChatGPT made both professions female, while Gemini did have a female nurse and male doctore, which is more stereotypical.\nThe takeaway is that bias in AI isn’t only about gender — it’s also about the qualities and responsibilities assigned to different professions. That subtle framing can reinforce cultural expectations, which is important to notice if we use these models in education or media."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Intro:\nDuring another one of my classes, we were reviewing past class final projects. One of the projects was for younger and older generations to learn the slang of each other. Thus, improving communication and understanding across generations. This project made me think: can ChatGPT explain these slang terms? I wanted to see whether ChatGPT-5 could explain some recent slang terms: 6 7, performative male, and aura farming. In my opinion, these are all pretty recent terms that have become popular. I saw that ChatGPT is able to use web search tools to get recent information, so let’s see if it knows these terms!\n\n\n\nperformative male\n\n\n\n\nPrompt:\nwhat does 6 7 mean?\n\n\nResponse:\n“6 7” is usually shorthand for the phrase “six, seven” → “ate (8)”.\nIt’s a play on the old kids’ joke: 👉 Why was 6 afraid of 7? 👉 Because 7 8 (ate) 9!\nSo if someone just says “6 7” (especially in texts or online slang), they’re probably referencing that joke, hinting at the pun “7 ate 9.”\nIt can also sometimes just be used jokingly as a meme-y way to say “watch out” or “be careful,” since it recalls the idea of 6 being scared of 7.\nDo you want me to also run through how people actually use “6 7” in modern slang (like on TikTok or in chats)?\n\n\nThoughts:\nHmm this is not the meaning of 6 7 that I know of…although I guess that 6 7 doesn’t have much of a meaning anyways. However, I know that people are definitely not referencing “7 ate 9” when they say 6 7. I asked ChatGPT-5 to give me the modern slang meaning of 6 7, but again it said\n“6 7” is modern shorthand for the “7 ate 9” joke, but now used as a quick meme-y way to say “watch out,” “I’m nervous,” or just to be goofy.\nAgain, not the right way that people are using 6 7. Maybe this is too recent of a term to test ChatGPT on\n\n\nPrompt:\nwhat does it mean if someone is a performative male and can you describe someone who is a performative male?\n\n\nResponse:\nWhen someone is described as a “performative male”, it usually means that their masculinity or male identity is expressed in a way that feels more like a performance for others rather than something authentic or natural to them. It’s about showing off being a man rather than just being one.\n\n\nKey Aspects of a Performative Male\n\nOveremphasis on Masculinity: He may exaggerate traits that are culturally coded as “manly” (strength, dominance, toughness, sexual conquest).\nAudience-Driven Behavior: His actions often shift depending on who’s watching—he’s “performing” masculinity to gain approval, status, or validation.\nSurface-Level Confidence: It can look like confidence, but it’s rooted in insecurity, since he feels the need to constantly prove himself.\nRigid Gender Roles: He might dismiss things seen as “feminine” and lean heavily into stereotypes (e.g., won’t show vulnerability, avoids admitting fear, scoffs at hobbies or traits not seen as masculine).\n\n\n\nExample of a Performative Male\nImagine a guy at a party who loudly talks about how much he can bench press, makes jokes about women belonging in the kitchen, and brags about dating multiple women—all while checking to see if the group of men around him are laughing or impressed. He’s not doing these things because they reflect who he is, but because he thinks that’s how a “real man” should act in front of others.\nBy contrast, someone who’s comfortable in their masculinity doesn’t need to constantly display or prove it; their sense of self isn’t dependent on performing for an audience.\nWould you like me to also explain how the term performative is used more broadly (outside gender/masculinity)? That might help frame it better.\n\n\nThoughts:\nSince I was thinking of a matcha-holding, wired heaphones-listening man reading a book about feminism, I wanted to see if ChatGPT could describe a performative male more physically. However, this was its response:\n\n\nAppearance & Clothing\n\nGym wear as casual fashion: Tight athletic shirts, sleeveless tops, or joggers that show off muscles even outside the gym.\nDesigner labels & flashy accessories: Branded sneakers, big watches, chains, or sunglasses indoors.\nOverly styled grooming: Perfectly gelled hair or meticulously trimmed beard to give off a curated “alpha male” vibe.\n“Hyper-masculine” looks: Leather jackets, ripped jeans, or outfits meant to project toughness and status.\n\n\n\n\nActivities & Interests\n\nGym & fitness culture: Not just working out, but constantly talking about lifting, protein shakes, or “the grind.”\nCar or tech flexing: Showing off cars, motorcycles, watches, or gadgets as proof of success.\nParty & nightlife: Prefers clubs, bottle service, VIP sections — places where being seen is as important as having fun.\nCompetitive hobbies: Sports betting, fantasy football, or anything where “winning” can be showcased.\nPerformative social media: Gym selfies, flexing wealth (trips, outfits, cars), or posting motivational quotes about hustle/grind culture.\n\nThis seems like the opposite of a “performative male” as term is known now and more of a literal performative male. So, I guess that ChatGPT doesn’t know about the performative male either. Let’s see if we have better luck with aura farming which in my opinion is the oldest slang term out of these.\n\n\nPrompt:\nwhat does aura farming mean?\n\n\nResponse:\n“Aura farming” is a newer slang term that’s been circulating among Gen Z / Gen Alpha that basically means trying (often subtly or performatively) to project a cool, charismatic presence — aka “vibe,” “aura,” or “energy.” ([Wiktionary][1])\nHere’s a breakdown:\n\n\n\n💡 Etymology & Meaning\n\nThe word “aura” in this sense refers to someone’s intangible “cool factor,” vibe, or personal presence. ([PureWow][2])\n“Farming” is borrowed from gaming jargon, where one “farms” (repeatedly does something) to earn rewards or points. In “aura farming,” it implies a repeated effort to accrue “aura points.” ([Wiktionary][1])\nSo put together, aura farming means consciously “cultivating” or “earning” aura by doing things that enhance one’s perceived aura. ([Wiktionary][1])\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Examples & Usage\n\nIn fiction, it can refer to characters always striking dramatic or “cool” poses or doing over-the-top displays, so people say they are “aura farming.” ([Wiktionary][1])\nIn real life / social media, it might look like:\n\nChoosing outfits, photos, or public stunts purely to enhance one’s image\nActing “effortlessly cool” while obviously having planned it\nDoing things to get people to notice but pretending you’re not trying\nCurating a social media persona that seems casual yet striking ([Parents][3])\n\n\nA common theme is the tension: if you try too hard, people call you out for “aura farming.” ([Parents][3])\n\n\nThoughts:\nIt got it! ChatGPT-5 was able to accurately describe what aura farming is. I noticed during this prompt it said that it was searching the web while it was creating the response while for the others it did not say it was searching the web. I bet this is why it was able to have an accurate definition. I wonder what prompts it to search the web sometimes, but not all the time."

    "text": "Destination Ideas (Good / Fairly Affordable Options from Philadelphia)\nHere are a mix of domestic + international spots. I’ve picked ones that tend to give good value, with decent weather in March, and manageable flights or drive.\n\n\n\nDestination\nWhat’s Good There\nThings to Watch / Cost Considerations\n\n\n\n\nFlorida (e.g. Orlando, Miami, Keys)\nWarm weather, lots of variety (beaches, nightlife, theme parks, nature). Florida often has good flight deals from Philly.\nMiami / the Keys can get pricier, especially hotels. Orlando has peak demand, so lodging can rise. Aim for mid‐week flights.\n\n\nPuerto Rico\nNo passport needed for U.S. citizens, tropical, beaches + culture + easy travel. Great weather in March. (Holland America Line)\nSome areas can be touristy / more expensive. If you go “off the beaten path” you’ll save.\n\n\nDominican Republic / Jamaica / Bahamas\nClassic beach vibes, warm temps, good resorts. March is good season. (expedia)\nResorts can vary hugely in price. All‐inclusive may seem pricier upfront but often gives better value. Flight timing matters.\n\n\nCuraçao / Aruba / Southern Caribbean\nVery nice weather, often lower rainfall, more off‐mainstream (so slightly cheaper and less crowded) than say, Cancun or Punta Cana. (Caribeez)\nLonger flights (so maybe higher airfare). Amenities may cost more depending on island.\n\n\nDomestic U.S. – Southern Cities (New Orleans, Charleston, Savannah)\nMore culture/history, good food, often cheaper lodging. Warm to mild weather by early‐mid March. Less travel hassle.\nNot beach warm everywhere; for full beach weather you might need Florida or coasts. Some tourist spots will bump up prices.\n\n\nDomestic U.S. – Cheap beach‐adjacent states (SC, GA, Florida Panhandle)\nLower cost than big destinations, beautiful scenery, more relaxed.\nWater may still be cool in some places; fewer direct flights so travel time matters."

Do you want me to do that?\n\nPrompt:\ncan you tell me pros and cons of these places\n\n\nResponse:\nCool, here are some pros and cons of Puerto Rico, Florida (especially the Keys + more general “beaches + fun”), and the Dominican Republic. This should help you evaluate them. If you want I can do cost estimates or compare a few specific spots in each."

(AAA)\nVariety of things to do — beaches, rainforest (El Yunque), bioluminescent bays, historic Old San Juan, good food culture. (Lonely Planet)\nRich culture + bilingual. Spanish + English spoken, so you get that Caribbean flavor but don’t feel totally foreign. (TravelAwaits)\nTravel convenience from the U.S. — relatively short flights, fewer visa/passport or customs complications compared to international destinations. (AAA)\n\nCons:\n\nInfrastructure issues — power outages, etc., can happen. Some parts of the roads or rural areas may be less developed. (Reddit)\nPotential for crowds + cost in popular areas — Old San Juan, big beaches or resorts tend to get busy and more expensive.\nWeather risks — though March is outside hurricane season, tropical weather can be unpredictable; occasional storms, rains, or rough seas.\nSome parts are more remote — if you want quieter, cheaper spots, travel time & cost (car rentals etc.) can add up, especially going beyond the main hubs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Intro\nLast week, I experimented with ChatGPT-5 to create a professional headshot for me. However, I can’t say it did very well… The pictures it created technically had the same clothes and accessories, but my face was not my face. I did not recognize her. I forgot about this idea for a few days, but then today I got Google Gemini Pro because it is free for students for a year. I see this right when I open the page:\n\n\n\nScreenshot\n\n\nWow! Look right at the center. Google Gemini advertises itself as being able to create a professional headshot, so let’s try it out! I clicked on that center panel from the home screen and this prompt was already written:\n\n\nPrompt:\nFirst ask me for a selfie. Transform my selfie into a fresh but professional image suitable for a social media profile. The lighting should be natural, flattering, and multidimensional. My head is slightly tilted so it doesn’t look stiff and it should look like I’m in a modern, bright office with a blurred background.\nMy thoughts: This prompt is pretty good in my opinion. It specifies the lighting, head position, and background which are not all features that I would think to intially add when I prompt an LLM. I like how they have this prompt ready for users to use.\nGemini-2.5 Flash then prompted me for a selfie and I gave it this:\n\n\n\nMy picture\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nHere’s a fresh, professional image suitable for a social media profile, with natural, flattering, and multidimensional lighting, a slight head tilt, and a modern, bright office with a blurred background:\n\n\n\nGemini response\n\n\nThis is SOOOO much better than ChatGPT’s response! The person in the picture still looks like me and it did exactly as the prompt said. I am in natural lighting, wearing business clothes, and in an office background. I’m especially impressed by the hair because that is what my hair normally looks like naturally and it did a good job of making it look similar but better than the frizzy hair I had from the rain in my initial picture. I want to see if it can make me smile.\n\n\nPrompt:\ncan you make me smiling and facing more forward?\n\n\nResponse:\nAbsolutely! Here’s an updated version where you are smiling and facing more forward:\n\n\n\nGemini response 2\n\n\nI guess it cannot predict what I look like smiling very well because this person is not me. I am also not facing more forward. I probably have to give it a reference of me smiling.\n\n\nPrompt:\nhere’s a picture of me smiling. Can you redo the headshot?\n\n\n\nmy picture\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\nI can certainly redo the headshot for you! Here’s a new professional headshot using your provided smiling image as a reference, maintaining the modern office background and professional aesthetic:\n\n\n\nGemini Response\n\n\nThis picture still did not use the smile from the picture that I gave it. So, I tried again with prompts “you did not change the picture” and “you still did not change the smile”. However, this picture remained. The person in the picture definitely looks like me, but it still doesn’t look exactly like me. For example, I would not have her as my LinkedIn profile picture. Overall, the initial picture that had same expression as the picture I gave it was very good, but when I asked it to change and even gave it another reference picture, Gemini was stubborn and did not change."
